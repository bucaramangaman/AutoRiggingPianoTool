# AutoRiggingPianoTool
Maya script for rigging and setting the keys to play a MIDI file. 3D model used for test (not mine): https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/grand-piano-marble-8d4142b2c2d94dc7a314764f621845c6

---------------------------------------------------

To install the tool, follow these steps:

-This first step is to install the python MIDO library into your Maya environment
*If you have the mido library from 'pypi.org' on your computer, you can skip step 0

0.a. Extract the zip file contents (pypi_install_maya) in 'Documents\maya\(version)\scripts'
0.b. Run the 'pypi_install_maya.py' inside the Maya script editor
0.c. Type 'mido' and click 'Install and remain'

Running the piano rig tool:

1. Open a scene with a piano (use the 'test folder' in attached if you wish https://drive.google.com/file/d/19kdWFDwda1LnDWkGJs7V6aNDO4gNlefm/view)
2. drag the script file (PianoRigger.py) to the script editos in Maya and run it
3. Follow the UI steps

-------

PD: There are MIDI files to test inside ASSETS folder
PD2: First 2 tracks of the midi file should suffice, or just one of those too
